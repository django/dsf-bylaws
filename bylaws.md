Directors shall be elected to two (2) year terms. All directors shall hold office until their respective successors are elected, or until their death, resignation, or removal.

#### 4.4.2 Process

Directors shall be elected to staggered terms. A quorum of the directorship shall be elected for odd year terms beginning with the election for the 2025 board.

The 1-indexed ranked results of the election for the 2023 board shall determine which term each director belongs to, with odd ranks being odd year terms and even ranks being even year terms. The same process shall be used to determine the term for board members elected upon an increase in the number of directors. 

### 4.5 Resignations

Any director of the Foundation may resign effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the president, the Secretary, or the Board of Directors of the Foundation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of the resignation. If the resignation specifies such a later time, the Board may elect a successor pursuant to Section 4.7 (Vacancies) of these bylaws to take office on the date the resignation becomes effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no director may resign if such resignation would leave the Foundation without a duly elected director or directors in charge of its affairs.

Such vote shall follow the requirements of Section 4.6.1.

### 4.7 Vacancies

A vacancy or vacancies on the Board shall be deemed to exist in case of the death, resignation, or removal of any director, or upon the increase in the number of directors, or if, for whatever reason, there are fewer directors on the Board than the full number then authorized by the Board. Such vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the remaining directors, though less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director. Directors appointed by the board shall serve until the next election 

### 4.8 Compensation

Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, and such reimbursement for expenses, as may be fixed or determined by the Board. 

### 4.9 Affiliations of Board Members

Any person running for the Board must disclose all affiliations (other than the Organization) as part of their candidate statement. Board Members must immediately disclose to the membership any changes in their affiliations that occur during their term of service. For purposes of this section, an affiliation exists when a Board Member or prospective Board Member:

1. is an employee, officer, or member of the Board of Directors of another entity;
2. maintains a significant consulting relationship with another entity; or
3. owns at least 1% of the equity or debt, or derivatives thereof, of another entity.

For purposes of this Section, a common affiliation includes all organizations that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the other entities declared as affiliations by other members of the Board of Directors.

### 4.10 Limits on Co‑affiliated Board Members

#### 4.10.1 **Two‑director cap.** No more than two (2) sitting directors may share a common affiliation as defined in Section 4.9.

#### 4.10.2 **Change in circumstances.** If, due to a change in employment, merger, or acquisition, the number of co‑affiliated directors rises above two, the affected directors must notify the Board within fourteen (14) days.

#### 4.10.3 **Voluntary resolution period.**

   * Within thirty (30) days of that notice the co‑affiliated directors must agree which director(s) will resign in order to restore compliance.
   * Directors should consider officer roles and essential responsibilities when deciding.
   * The resignations take effect only when at least **five (5)** directors will remain seated, or simultaneous appointments are ready to keep the Board at or above the minimum size required by Section 4.2.

#### 4.10.4 **Default rule if no agreement.**

   * If the co‑affiliated directors do not reach agreement within the thirty‑day period, the Board will vote to decide which director(s) shall resign, taking officer roles into account.
   * If the Board vote results in a tie, the director(s) with the **most recent** start date(s) will resign first until compliance is restored.

#### 4.10.5 **Vacancy filling.** Vacancies created under this Section must be filled as soon as practical under Section 4.5. The resigning director(s) may continue in a non‑voting advisory capacity until replacements are seated to ensure continuity of officer duties.

#### 4.10.6 **Election eligibility.** A candidate whose seating would cause the Board to exceed the two‑director cap is ineligible. When multiple candidates with the same affiliation are elected in the same ballot, they are seated in the order they cross the winning threshold; any remaining candidates from that affiliation become ineligible once the cap is reached.
